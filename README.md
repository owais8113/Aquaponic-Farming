Aquaponic Farming Control System using IoT
Aquaponics combines aquaculture (fish farming) with hydroponics (growing plants without soil). With IoT sensors, we can monitor water quality, temperature, and other parameters remotely. It's a great way to optimize the system and ensure the fish and plants thrive. We are using HTTP request response for data transmission over local server
