Aquaponic Farming Control System using IoT
Aquaponics combines aquaculture (fish farming) with hydroponics (growing plants without soil). With IoT sensors, we can monitor water quality, temperature, and other parameters remotely. It's a great way to optimize the system and ensure the fish and plants thrive. We are using HTTP request response for data transmission over local server

Our project focuses on developing sustainable and efficient aquaponic farms using IoT
technology. Integrating multiple sensors, including water quality, temperature, water quality
and nutrient concentration sensors, the system provides real-time monitoring and remote
access to important information. Alerts are generated for all differences in the agreement,
allowing timely intervention and quality control. In addition, the system includes actuators for
functions such as feeding and water circulation, reducing the impact of the book and increasing
the impact on the environment. With this approach, we aim to increase crop yield while
minimizing water waste and resource use. Our programs are helping advance precision
agriculture and pioneering the success of aquaponics as a sustainable method of food
production in the face of global challenges.
